PICO Y PLACA PREDICTOR

This program is a "Pico y Placa" predictor. The inputs are a license plate number (the full number, not the last digit), a date (as a String), and a time, and the program will return whether or not that car can be on the road. The frontend of the program was made with javascript(React) and the backend with php(Laravel).
